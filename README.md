The Magical Interplanetary Trajectory Tool (MITT) will be an advanced yet intuitive astrodynamic navigation tool. It will allow the user to plan realistic, complex interplanetary trajectories in a fully GUI environment with little prior experience.

MITT will evaluate the orbits of planets using conic sections, but the evaluation of vessel trajectories will be fully numerical to allow for burn time and other physical effects to be accurately computed.

MITT will work for any kind of macroscopic particle system, including single and multiple star systems. One day, perhaps, even relativistic effects will be computed, allowing for accurate trajectories to be computed around relativistic gravity sources such as black holes.

Goals:
* MITT will allow the full suite of interplanetary trajectory tricks---all the way from simpe hohmann transfers to multiple stages of gravity assists like the Voyager and MESSENGER missions
* MITT will factor in burn time, allowing the use of ion engines and brachistochrone trajectories
* MITT will factor in the Oberth effet and other physical bonuses
